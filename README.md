# hello-world
This is my first experience adding something to GitHub! I'm using the guide.

Hi. My name is Joseph Ramirez

I am interested in cooperatives and, generally, democracy. This is because I think that stakeholders 
that are affected by decisions need their input considered. This can include workers, consumers, or 
entire communities, depending on who is affected by major decisions. I'm also interested in competitive 
gaming, music, movies, and especially media where various voices and experiences are included.

I appreciate honesty, and also goofiness and dry humor  ^_^

Edit 02-11-23 : This is very cool to see this 6 years later. I completely forgot I set this up.
